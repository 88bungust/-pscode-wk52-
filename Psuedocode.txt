// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

1. Ask for the input of the first number and let this number be "a"
2. Ask for the input of the second number and let this number be "b"
3. Add a+b using the sum of "a"+"b" to get the answer "c"
4. Print the value of "c" from the calculation

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

1.Ask for the input of a number and let this number be "a"
2.If the denomenator is "0" then print even
3.If the denomenator is not "0" then print odd

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

A)
1. Ask for input of a number and let this number be "a"
2. Ask for input of a number and let this number be "b"
3. Ask for input of a number and let this number be "c"
4. Ask for input of a number and let this number be "d"
5. Ask for input of a number and let this number be "e"
B)
Calculate using addition "a"+"b"+"c"+"d"+"e"
MINIMUN)
1.Calculate the difference of "b", "C", "d" and "e" in order to determine if "a" is less than these numbers
2. If value is TRUE then let "a" be "min"
3. If value is FALSE then calculate the difference of "a","c","d", "e" to determine if less than "b"
4. If value is TRUE then let "b" be "min"
5. If value is FALSE then calculate the difference of "a","b","d","e" to determine if "c" is less than these numbers
6.If value is TRUE then let "d" be "min"
7. If value is FALSE then calculate the difference of "a", "b","c","e"
If valve is TRUE then let "e" be "min"
8. If value is FALSE then calculate the difference of "a","b","c","d" to determine if less than "e"
MAX)
1.Calculate the difference of "b", "C", "d" and "e" in order to determine if "a" is greater than these numbers
2. If value is TRUE then let "a" be "max"
3. If value is FALSE then calculate the difference of "a","c","d", "e" to determine if greater than "b"
4. If value is TRUE then let "b" be "max"
5. If value is FALSE then calculate the difference of "a","b","d","e" to determine if "c" is greater than these numbers
6.If value is TRUE then let "d" be "max"
7. If value is FALSE then calculate the difference of "a", "b","c","e"
If valve is TRUE then let "e" be "max"
8. If value is FALSE then calculate the difference of "a","b","c","d" to determine if greater than "e"

D)
1.Print "THE minimum of these 5 numbers is" then print the value of "min"
2.Print "The maximum of these 5 numbers is" then print the value of "min"
